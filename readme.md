# Yeoman Webapp with React and Browserify

This is a variation of [Yeoman's](http://yeoman.io) generated  [gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp) with the inclusion of [Browserify](http://browserify.org) and [React](http://reactjs.com). I consider this more a recipe to webapp than a generator, as it doesn't significantly change webapp's features, such as SASS, LiveReload, etc., but rather easily allows for Browserify syntax.
